## Milestone 3

For this milestone, we preprocessed our data before training it under RBF and Linear Regression. In order to get our ground truth, we had to cross-reference the ID of the associated MIDI file with the following [link](https://www.ifs.tuwien.ac.at/mir/msd/partitions/msd-MAGD-genreAssignment.cls). After preprocessing and training our data we found a mean squared error of 23 for our testing set, 14 for our training set of our linear model 13 for our training, and 14 for our testing set of our RBF Model.
