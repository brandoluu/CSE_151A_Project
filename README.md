## Milestone 2

### Initial Data Exploration:
The dataset contains 16 different subdirectories, each containing different audio samples. Using the `pretty-midi` utility functions, we can extract the different attributes of the dataset. There are ______ observations and ________ attributes. 

### Preprocessing:
Upon looking at the data, we noticed that some of the subfolders have key errors or corrupted data. We have decided to drop all corrupted data with errors since there is a large amount of data.
